## Task 2: Technology Stack

**Type of Application: Mobile and Web**

I would choose both mobile and web applications. A mobile app offers users convenience for quick actions like paying rent or submitting maintenance requests on the go. A web app provides a more detailed interface for tasks that benefit from a larger screen, such as managing multiple requests or viewing community events.

**Software Architecture: Microservices**

A microservices architecture allows each feature (e.g., rent payments, maintenance orders) to be developed and maintained independently. It also enhances scalability and fault isolation, meaning issues in one service won't affect the entire application.

**Software Stack: MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js)**

The MERN stack is ideal because it allows full-stack JavaScript development. **MongoDB** handles various data efficiently, **Express.js** and **Node.js** manage the backend and APIs, and **React** (or React Native) provides a dynamic user interface for both web and mobile platforms. This stack supports fast development and scalability.
