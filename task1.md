## Task 1: Client-Server Architecture

**Benefits of Client-Server Architecture:**

1. **Easy to Manage:** The server allows for central control over data and resources, making it easier to perform maintenance, apply updates, and manage security.
2. **Can Handle Growth:** Client-server architecture can easily handle an increase in users or workload. The server can be upgraded to handle more clients, or more servers can be added to share the load.

**Potential Drawback of Client-Server Architecture:**

- **Risk of Server Failure:** If the server experiences problems or goes offline, all connected clients may lose access to the resources or services it provides, causing disruptions.
